            as part of the Wildlife Conservationists Research Group, our mission
            is to contribute to the preservation of those wildlife species by
            using our skills and expertise in research, to relearn and reimagine
            the livelihoods of those organisms, plus the ways of preserving them
            for the betterment of the African continentâ€™s wildlife conservation
            economy. We, therefore, intend to make research to understand the
            ways the processes that lead to the extinction of wildlife species,
            learn more about those causes and encourage the application of the
            21st Century skills by young conservationists to aid in ensuring the
            conservation of those living organisms
